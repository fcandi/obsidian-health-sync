# Garmin Health Sync

Sync steps, sleep, heart rate, stress, activities and more from Garmin Connect into Obsidian Daily Notes — as frontmatter properties you can query with Dataview.

> **Desktop only.** This plugin uses Electron's BrowserWindow for Garmin Connect authentication and does not work on mobile.

> **Note:** This plugin uses Garmin Connect's internal web API through an Electron browser session — there is no official third-party API available.

## Features

- **Auto-sync on startup** — checks the last 7 days and fills in any missing health data
- **Manual sync** — sync any open Daily Note via command palette
- **Backfill** — bulk-sync a date range (e.g. the last 3 months)
- **20+ metrics** — steps, sleep score, HRV, stress, body battery, SpO2, weight, and more
- **Activity tracking** — each workout appears as a human-readable summary
- **Workout location** — reverse-geocoded place name from your first GPS activity
- **Smart detection** — automatically picks up your Daily Notes path and format from Periodic Notes or the core Daily Notes plugin
- **Subdirectory support** — finds existing Daily Notes in nested folders (e.g. `Journal/2024-07/`)
- **Language auto-detection** — UI language is set from your Obsidian language (EN, DE, ZH, JA, ES, FR)
- **Optional structured data** — machine-readable `trainings` field for advanced Dataview queries
- **Property prefix** — optionally adds an `ohs_` prefix to all frontmatter properties to avoid naming conflicts with other plugins

## Frontmatter Output

### Metrics

```yaml
---
steps: 15185
resting_hr: 69
sleep_score: 81
sleep_duration: 7h 43min
hrv: 39
stress: 30
workout_location: Bad Honnef, Germany
---
```

### Activities

Each workout is written as a frontmatter key with a summary string:

```yaml
---
hiking: 8.2 km · 157min · Ø105 bpm · 696 kcal
e_bike: 22.1 km · 65min · Ø112 bpm · 420 kcal
---
```

Only days with actual workouts get activity keys. The plugin never touches your note content — it only adds or updates frontmatter properties.

### Trainings (optional, machine-readable)

Enable "Machine-readable trainings" in settings to add a structured `trainings` field for Dataview queries:

```yaml
---
trainings:
  - type: hiking
    category: outdoor
    distance_km: 8.2
    duration_min: 157
    avg_hr: 105
    calories: 696
  - type: e_bike
    category: cycling
    distance_km: 22.1
    duration_min: 65
    avg_hr: 112
    calories: 420
---
```

## Requirements

- **Obsidian Desktop** (Windows, macOS, Linux) — the plugin does not work on mobile
- **Garmin account** with access to Garmin Connect
- **Daily Notes** or **Periodic Notes** plugin enabled (or configure the path manually in settings)

## Installation

### From Community Plugins (recommended)

1. Open Obsidian Settings → Community Plugins → Browse
2. Search for "Garmin Health Sync"
3. Install and enable the plugin
4. Log in to Garmin Connect in the plugin settings

### Manual

1. Download `main.js` and `manifest.json` from the [latest release](https://github.com/fcandi/garmin-health-sync/releases)
2. Create a folder `.obsidian/plugins/garmin-health-sync/` in your vault
3. Copy both files into that folder
4. Enable the plugin in Settings → Community Plugins

## Usage

### Auto-sync

On every Obsidian startup, the plugin checks the last 7 days and fills in any missing health data automatically. No action needed.

### Manual sync

Open a Daily Note and run **Garmin Health Sync: Sync current note** from the Command Palette (Cmd/Ctrl+P).

### Backfill historical data

Have years of Garmin data? You can bulk-sync any date range:

1. Open the Command Palette (Cmd/Ctrl+P)
2. Search for **"Backfill health data"**
3. Pick a start and end date
4. The plugin fetches all data for that range with rate-limiting to avoid API throttling

## Activity Key Normalization

Garmin's `typeKey` values are normalized to cleaner canonical keys:

| Provider Key | Canonical Key | Category |
|---|---|---|
| `e_bike_fitness` | `e_bike` | cycling |
| `e_bike_mountain` | `e_mtb` | cycling |
| `resort_skiing_snowboarding` | `skiing` | winter |
| `backcountry_skiing_snowboarding` | `backcountry_skiing` | winter |
| `stand_up_paddleboarding` | `sup` | water |
| `fitness_equipment` | `gym_equipment` | gym |

All other Garmin keys pass through unchanged (e.g. `hiking`, `running`, `cycling`, `swimming`, `strength_training`, `yoga`, ...).

### Activity Categories

Each activity is assigned a category:

| Category | Examples |
|---|---|
| `cycling` | cycling, e_bike, e_mtb, mountain_biking, indoor_cycling, road_biking |
| `running` | running, trail_running, treadmill, ultra_run |
| `walking` | walking, indoor_walking |
| `outdoor` | hiking, mountaineering, rock_climbing, bouldering |
| `swimming` | swimming, pool_swimming, open_water_swimming |
| `winter` | skiing, backcountry_skiing, cross_country_skiing, snowboarding |
| `water` | sup, rowing, kayaking, surfing, sailing |
| `gym` | strength_training, gym_equipment, elliptical, yoga, pilates, hiit |
| `racket` | tennis, badminton, squash, table_tennis, pickleball |
| `team` | soccer, basketball, volleyball, rugby |
| `other` | golf, meditation, multi_sport |

## Data & Privacy

This plugin makes network requests to two external services:

- **Garmin Connect** — a browser window authenticates with Garmin Connect using your credentials. No password is stored by the plugin; only a session token (valid for 30 days) is saved in Obsidian's local plugin data.
- **Nominatim (OpenStreetMap)** — if the "Workout location" feature is enabled, the GPS coordinates of your first activity are sent to `nominatim.openstreetmap.org` for reverse geocoding. You can disable this in settings under *Workout location*.

No data is sent to any other server.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev    # watch mode
npm run build  # production build
```
